### What I learned
So, what I learned is that it's better to design a webpage for mobile devices first and then adjust it for desktop screens. I found out that if you create a desktop site first, it can be hard to make it look good on mobile devices. Plus, it can result in a poor user experience. On another note, I also learned about using variables in CSS for colors. It's cool because you can define colors once and reuse them throughout your code, which makes it easier to style your webpage and keep your code organized.
